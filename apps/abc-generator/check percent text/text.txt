Hi, {you}! How's {your family} doing?

They're good, thanks for {asking about} them. I {am} {watching a movie} with {my son} {right now}.

That's nice! What movie {are} {you guys} {watching}?

We {just} {watched a movie} called "Finding Nemo". {I} {had a great time} {watching a movie} with {my son}.

{I} {would like to go} {watch a movie} too. Do {you} {know why} {Monica} {is} not {here} {anymore}? {She} {was} always {talking to} {me} about {watching a movie} together.

{I} {don't know why} {Monica} {is} not {here}, but {I} {will} ask {her} later. {My cousin} {talks to} {her} {every day} and might know {why}.

{I} {was} {at the restaurant} {last night} with {my neighbor}. {We} {talked to} {someone} {who} {is} {close to home} and {goes to the party} {every day}. {I} {don't know why} {he} {is} always {doing that}.

{I} {was} {at my house} {yesterday} {reading a book}. {I} {never} {talked to} {him} {when} {I} {was there}. {Maybe} {he} {is} just {watching a movie} or {talking to} {someone} {else}.

{Everyone} {has been} {asking about} {you}. {I} {heard} {you} {got sick}. {Is} {everything} {okay} {now}?

Yes, {I} {got sick} {in the morning} but {I} {am there} now. {I} {just} {talked to} {her} and {she} said {she} {will} {talk to} {me} {later}.

{That's} {great} to hear. {I} {had a great time} {talking to} {you}. {Let's} {talk to} {each other} {more often}.

{I} {always} {enjoy} {talking to} {you} too. {Let's} {keep in touch} and {talk to} {each other} {every day} if {possible}.
