Hey, have you talked to Monica lately?
Yeah, she told me she would like to go out.
Oh really? Where does she want to go?
She said she would like to go with her family at night, but also with us right now
I don't know why everyone goes to the party with you guys at night.
Well, someone is going to the party with my family.
Is everyone doing that right now at the restaurant?
No, everyone is watching a movie at my house because I suggested it.
Oh, is Monica watching the movie with you guys?
Yeah, she's watching the movie right now.
Someone talks to you every day, is it your neighbor?
Yeah, my neighbor talks to me every day at the restaurant, but my cousin talks to me every day close to home.
Is your cousin the one who was at your house last night?
Yeah, that's right. And I don't know why Monica goes to the party every day.
By the way, is Monica with you guys right now?
I'm not sure, maybe she is doing something close to home.
