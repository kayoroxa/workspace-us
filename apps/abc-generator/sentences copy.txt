I want to spend time discussing the book we talked about earlier.
When I talked to my friend, we discussed the same topic we talked about last time.
I miss the time we spent together relaxing and talking about various things.
Can you help me find someone who can read a book to me while I work?
I had to cancel my appointment, so I have some free time now.
It's important to have an appointment with someone who can help us.
I enjoy spending time with my family, but sometimes I just want to be alone.
I can't go to bed without spending some time talking to my partner.
When I talked to my colleague, they mentioned they have an appointment somewhere else.
It's great that we had a great time together.
